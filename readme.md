# INTRODUCTION

This README describes the general architecture and steps required to build GeoTower.  It assumes that the EMS solution and associated projects have been downloaded and are available to build.

# ARCHITECTURE

The GeoTower solution can be opened in Xamarin or Visual Studio for Mac.  

The solution consists of three projects:

1.  **WatchTower** - This is a library with common functionality used by both the Android and iOS applications.  Functionality in this library includes classes used to send EDXL messages from the device to the server, and code to parse the data packets coming from connected Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices.

2.  **WatchTower.Droid** - This contains the source code for the Android version of GeoTower.  

3.  **WatchTower.iOS** - This contains the source code for the iOS version of GeoTower.



# BUILDING THE SHARED GeoTower PROJECT

1. Ensure that all the required Portable Class Library (PCL) EMS libraries are referenced appropriately in the shared GeoTower project.  These libraries are used for handling and serializing EDXL messages.  These libraries can be generated by downloading the EMS solution and compiling the PCL version of the libraries.  Note that to add references, you can establish a NuGet repository for Xamarin or Visual Studio to use, or manually copy and reference the EMS libraries as needed.

2. Build the shared GeoTower project.
